# Fluke Play
Cryptoeconomics is a serious business. Let's make time for play ü§æ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Fluke Play is a game fully owned by player communities. No pre-mining, no team allocation.

## Play with Coins
Submit crypto coin for a chance to win 3X, 10X, 100X, ... up to 1000000X of the coins you play (caped at 90% of the reward pool). If unlucky, your coins grow the reward pool ready for your next move.

## Play with Tokens
Players may also play using their FLK tokens. Rewards will be slighly more than playing with coins of equivalent value, depending on the size of the reward pool. The larger the reward pool, the more the reward.

## Breeding
Players that feel lucky may submit FLK tokens and a factor ***N*** between 2 and 1,000,0000. The tokens will be imediately burnt. If lucky, the player will receive ***N***X the number of tokens they played.

# The Token
The Fluke Token (FLK) represents a share of the game's success. It is backed by the treasury pool. The treasury pool is where all games revenues are transfered to. The **nominal value** of the FLK token is the value of the treasury pool divided by FLK total supply.

## Earning FLK
FLK tokens can only be earned by players.

### By Just Playing
Regardless of wining or loosing, every player gets up to 1 FLK token for each played coin.

For the first 2,000 moves, there is FLK bonus of 1,024 FLK per move. The bonus halves every 2,000 moves until no bonus is given out. Therefore, in the second block of 2,000 moves, a player gets 512 FLK per move. Playing too smal amount of coins may result i getting proportionally partial bonus for the moves.

### By Winning
Wins are paid out in FLK tokens. If you play 1 coin and win 3X, you will receive 3X of the coins you played in FLK. Your just won coins will be transfered to the treasury pool for safe keeping.

## Withdrawing Wins
At any time, a player can send FLK tokens to the contract and receive coins back. The FLK **nominal value** is used as exchange rate. Withdrawal is subject to 10% withdrawal fees.

# Tokenomic

FLK values is backed by the treasury pool.

## Issuing üéÅ

FLK tokens are issued to a player for each coin played. 10% of the coins played are then transfered from reward pool to treasury pool to back the newly issued FLK tokens, while ensuring all this increases the value of existing coins or at least does not dilute the value of existing coins.

When a player wins, their won coins are transfered to the treasury pool and new FLK tokens with value equal to the won coins are issued to the player. As such the value of all FLK tokens does not change as a result of issuing FLK tokens to winners.

## Burning üî•
When playing with FLK tokens, unlucky players' tokens are burnt, reducing FLK supply and increasing the value of existing coins.

Exchanging FLK tokens for coins is subject to 10% fee. The fee is retained in the treasury pool, increasing the value of remaining coins.

## Treasury Pool Funding
Treasury pool is funded from regular 10% contributions from reward pool and 10% withdraw fees. 

## Reward Pool Funding
The reward pool is funded by players on each move.

In addition, the contract allows anyone that feels generous to donate to the reward pool to entice and tout players to try their luck.

# Multichain ‚á∂

Fluke Play contract will be deployed on different chains to make it possible for different chains communities to play with their favourate coins. Naturally, for each supported coin there is a separate reward and treasury pools. This allows different communities to compete and demonstrate their unity and collective power. Community organizers may donate coins to the reward pool to incentivise players within their community.

Don't see your favourate coin? Please file an issue in the issues section.
